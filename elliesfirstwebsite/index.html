        <h1><u>Ellie's Website!</u></h1>
        <p>In this website, you will learn a little bit about me.</p>
        <h2>Where I Live</h2>
        <p>I live in a neighborhood called Inwood. It's located in Uptown Manhattan. I love living there. Here's some of the things I love most about it:</p> 
        <ul><li>The restuarants on Dyckman create a nice nightlife </li>
        <li>There are two parks within walking distance from my house, Inwood Hill Park and Fort Tryon Park.</li>
        <li>There are a lot of nice places to watch the sunset</li>
        <li>There's like three 99 cent stores for no reason</li>
        <li>Sometimes at night when the window's open, you can hear people arguing and you stick your head out the window to see what's happening and you see that five 
        other people are doing the same exact thing that you are because we're all chismosos</li></ul>
        <br>
        <p>Here's what Inwood Hill Park looks like:</p>

        <p>As you can see, this park is gorgeous, and remains gorgeous through every season of the year. My favorite times to come down here are in the fall and summer though.</p>
        
        <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
        <p>As someone who doesn't eat any animal products, it's hard to find food that I can eat. Luckily, Mexican food has a lot of things that I can make vegan. </p>

        <p>Guacamole, the BEST part of Mexican food, is vegan... so I'm chillin.</p>
       
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>On the weekends, I like to practice softball. There's a field by my dad's house that we go to, and it's always really fun.</p>

        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>I have a mom, a dad, an older brother, and a stepmom. My brother's 9 years older than me, his name is JP, and he's one of my favorite people ever (:.
